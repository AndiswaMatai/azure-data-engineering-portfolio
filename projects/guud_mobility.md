# 🏎️ GUUD Mobility — Azure Data Engineering Case Study

## Business Context
**GUUD Mobility** provides urban mobility services, managing fleet operations, routes, and revenue.
Core operational and financial data was hosted **on-premise in SQL Server**, creating challenges
for scalability, reporting speed, and executive visibility.

---

## Problem Statement
The business faced several data challenges:

- Fragmented operational and financial datasets
- Manual reporting cycles taking multiple days
- Limited visibility into real-time fleet performance
- Delayed decision-making for route and utilization optimization
- Lack of executive-level KPIs across fleet, routes, and revenue

---

## Solution Overview
An **end-to-end Azure data engineering platform** was designed and implemented to modernize
data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analytics.
