Monitoring & Governance Overview
Azure Data Engineering Portfolio –
________________________________________
1. Purpose
This document describes the monitoring, governance, and security framework implemented in the Azure Data Engineering project. It ensures data integrity, auditability, and compliance, while enabling operational efficiency and executive reporting.
________________________________________
2. Scope
Covers the end-to-end Azure-based solution:
•	Data Ingestion – Azure Data Factory pipelines
•	Data Storage – Azure Data Lake (ADLS)
•	Data Transformation – Azure Databricks
•	Data Warehouse – Azure Synapse Analytics
•	Analytics & Reporting – Power BI dashboards
•	Security & Compliance – Azure Active Directory (AAD) & Key Vault
________________________________________
3. Data Monitoring
Area	Tools & Techniques	Purpose
Pipeline Health	ADF Monitoring, Alerts	Ensure ETL jobs complete successfully; catch failures early
Data Quality	Databricks Unit Tests, SQL Validation	Detect missing, duplicate, or malformed data
Data Freshness	ADF Triggers, Timestamps	Ensure near real-time availability of datasets
Performance	Synapse Query Monitoring, Spark Metrics	Optimize query & transformation performance
________________________________________
4. Governance & Compliance
4.1 Access Control
•	Azure Active Directory (AAD) manages role-based access
•	Principle of least privilege applied to pipelines, data storage, and reports
4.2 Data Lineage
•	Track source-to-dashboard flow using:
o	Databricks notebooks with version control
o	Synapse table and view documentation
o	Power BI lineage features
4.3 Auditability
•	Pipeline run logs retained in Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
•	Transformation and load processes versioned via GitHub
•	Historical snapshots stored in ADLS for audit purposes
4.4 Security
•	Sensitive data stored with encryption at rest (ADLS) and in transit
•	Secrets managed in Azure Key Vault
•	Periodic security reviews of ADF, Databricks, and Synapse permissions
________________________________________
5. Alerting & Notifications
•	ADF alerts trigger on pipeline failures or threshold breaches
•	Email & Teams notifications for operational teams
•	Power BI refresh failures logged with automated alerting
________________________________________
6. Documentation & Knowledge Management
•	All pipeline logic documented in notebooks and scripts
•	Data models and tables defined with metadata, descriptions, and lineage
•	Governance and monitoring procedures versioned in GitHub Docs folder
________________________________________
7. Benefits & Business Outcomes
•	Reduced manual data quality checks
•	Improved operational efficiency via automated alerts
•	Increased audit readiness for regulators
•	Near real-time dashboards for executive decision-making
•	Ensured secure and compliant data pipelines
