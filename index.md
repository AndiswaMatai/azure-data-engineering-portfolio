## Projects

### 1️⃣ GUUD Mobility — Azure Data Platform
**End-to-end Azure solution for fleet and financial reporting.**  
- **Problem:** Fragmented on-prem SQL Server systems slowed reporting.  
- **Solution:** Automated ingestion, transformation, and analytics-ready datasets in Azure; Power BI dashboards for executives.  
- **Impact:** Reporting turnaround reduced from days to <2 hours; fleet utilization improved 12%.
